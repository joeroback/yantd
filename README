yantd - Yet Another Network Traffic Daemon for OpenWrt

Initially and loosely based off the ttraff daemon from DD-WRT. I have Comcast
cable and they have a 250GB per month limit. I like to see my external bandwidth
on a month by month basis with history. This makes collectd not such a good
option since it is a rolling history.
