yantd - Yet Another Network Traffic Daemon for OpenWrt

Initially and loosely based off the ttraff daemon from DD-WRT. I have Comcast
cable and they have a 250GB per month limit. I like to see my external bandwidth
on a month by month basis with history. This makes collectd not such a good
option since it is a rolling history.

I recently saw another project called vnStat. I initially thought I just
did a lot of work for nothing. Then I realized vnStat limitations.
Though it keeps a nice level of statistics, it only keeps them for a month.
Then after a year, stats are discarded. While this is a nice feature,
I would like the ability to keep statistics for as long as one wants.

I've posted the question of keeping past statisitics to the vnStat forums.
If keeping past history is of no interest to the developer, I will continue
on with this project.

I've put together a list of things I would like to do with this project
in the immediate future, pending an answer from the vnStat developer
about keeping past stats data.

(*) yantd.conf file
(*) hourly, daily, monthly, yearly stats keep indefinitely (configurable).
(*) advanced stats will require more advanced database file
(*) png image output for nice graphs like vnstati
(*) Support for BSD platforms like FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc.
(*) optional ncurses interface
